# Dotfiles

My main dotfiles for more easily replicating setups across machines.

Running the `install.sh` script will symlink the files to their relevant locations (mainly in the home directory).

I've heard that `stow` is also good for making the symlinks but it seemed like this was simpler.

```console
sh install.sh
```
